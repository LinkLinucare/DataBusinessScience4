#Conclussion
#Smaller loans are more common in the Cosmetics Sales, Entertainment, and Clothing sectors, while sectors like Agriculture tend to get larger loans.

#The median loan amounts are similar for both genders, but male borrowers have a wider IQR. This can show that they receive slightly larger loans withitn the q1-q3
